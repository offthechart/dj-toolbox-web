# DJ Toolbox: Web Version
Web application providing tools for DJs to interact with the radio station's systems

## Disclaimer
The code in this repository is rather old and is unlikely to work out of the box. It is also highly likely that it suffers from security vulnerabilities.

## Background
This web application provided the means for DJs around the country (and the world) to manage their shows. Amongst other features, it enabled:

* Reporting of music played for licensing purposes and to populate the website's now playing data
* Indication of whether they were on air or not when broadcasting live
* Basic interactions with the station playout system
* Requires jQuery 1.6.2, jQuery UI 1.8.16 and Smoothness CSS

## Questions?
Feel free to create an issue. It's an awfully long time since I maintained this code however, so I can't guarantee I can remember how it works!
